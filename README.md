# Threat intel frameworkish
Horrible code with simple json config to create a local db

## Inspiration
Nothing is free, and there is no good framework so I just made a shitty one :^)

## Usage
Edit the config file with more information, run the server and run something on the specified port.

## Todos 
* Stop using freaking wget and swap to request
* Better file movement for less file instability problems
* Faster rollout of new IOCs (Attempt automation)
* Compress for better storage
* Create a docker file
* Maybe some kind of horrible API
* Set up self hosting. Sockets are safe \o/
* RSS feed :D
